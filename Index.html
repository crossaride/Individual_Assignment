            <h2>Pokemon Gen 1</h2>
                The first generation of Pokémon games, known among older fans as the color generation 
                or the chromatic generation due to the names of the versions released, is the initial 
                set of four Pokémon games released.

                Beginning with Pokémon Red and Green, and later joined by third version Blue and the 
                special edition Yellow in Japan, the Generation I games were developed beginning 
                as early as 1990 from an idea that Satoshi Tajiri had thought of and pitched to Nintendo 
                with the help of Shigeru Miyamoto. The inspiration for many of the key mechanics introduced 
                in this generation came from Tajiri's childhood interest in bug collecting, 
                with the trading system between two Game Boys being thought of when he imagined a caterpillar
                crawling across the Game Link Cable between two systems.
            </p><p>
                This generation was localized into English, with initial attempts to keep the Pocket Monsters 
                name for international use blocked due to the Monster in My Pocket franchise leading to 
                the release as "Pokémon". Further alterations made in the localization included the 
                combination of Red, Green, and Blue into the English versions of Pokémon Red and Blue, 
                using Red and Green's wild Pokémon encounter lists but Blue's slightly improved graphics. 
                The simultaneous release of the games and anime led to an almost-overnight surge in popularity, 
                cementing the Pokémon franchise firmly as a Nintendo mainstay alongside Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda.
