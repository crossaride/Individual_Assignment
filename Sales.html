            <p>When Nintendo released the first Pokémon game in Japan on February 27, 
                1996, no one would have thought that it was the birth hour of the second 
                largest video game franchise in history. Over the next 23 years, 
                the Japanese video game giant went on to sell more than 300 million copies 
                of more than 70 Pokémon titles, trailing only Super Mario in terms of its
                longevity and global popularity.
            </p><p>
                To mark the 23rd anniversary of the Pokémon franchise’s birthday, 
                Nintendo announced two new entries to the popular series on Wednesday. 
                The two new games named “Pokémon Sword” and “Pokémon Shield” are role-playing games 
                in line with the franchise’s core group of games and its biggest sellers. 
                Both games will be released for the Nintendo Switch later this year, possibly 
                further boosting sales of Nintendo’s first hybrid console.
            </p><p>
                As the following chart illustrates, a new Pokémon game is all but a guaranteed 
                mega-seller for Nintendo. The top 10 Pokémon games alone sold nearly 180 million 
                copies and a total of twelve different titles reached the milestone of selling 
                10 million copies or more. A look at last year’s best-selling games across all platforms 
                shows how rare that achievement really is: Red Dead Redemption 2 was the only game 
                to sell more than 10 million copies in 2018.
